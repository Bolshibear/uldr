# uldr
A game of long winded explanations to move from point a to point b

It consists of a minimalistic explanation of a problem and the player is left to fend for themselves to figure out where the barriers are and where they must go.

To play you just load the python file in a terminal and enter a path that you think will lead you to the end.

The only letters you can enter are u, l, d and r. (up, left, down, right)
